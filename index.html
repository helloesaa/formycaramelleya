            <p>Here, everything about you will be etched forever. First of all, allow me to thank you for coloring my life in ways I could never imagine. You bring me boundless happiness, even with just the sound of your gentle voice. Every word you speak is like a beautiful melody that soothes the soul. You made me believe that in this world, there is something truly beautiful, and that beauty is you, Caramelleya.
                Every smile of yours is a light that illuminates every corner of my heart, warming spaces that were once dark. Your gaze brings peace, erases all doubts, and makes me feel safe in this world. Every moment we spend together is an invaluable gift. In every second we share, I feel like the world stops for a moment, just to admire the beauty you bring.
                You are the dream come true, Caramelleya, who taught me that true love exists, and I found it in you. With you, I experience a wonder I've never known before. You are the reason I believe that true happiness can be found in a sincere heart.
                I want to always be there for you, just as you have always been there for me, walking through every twist and turn of life together, because I know there is nothing more beautiful than sharing life with you.</p>
